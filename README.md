## Overview

These materials can be used either as a stand-alone and self-contained course on adversarial AI, or as a hands-on component of a more detailed university-level course on adversarial AI and related topics. This project began from student lecture notes from [Dr. Allison Bishop](https://www.thecomputersciencecomedian.com/)’s graduate Adversarial AI course at the City College of New York.

**For Instructors**: See the [📚 Instructor Manual](INSTRUCTOR_MANUAL.md) for accessing encrypted solutions and course management.

**For Contributors**: Check out our [🤝 Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to help improve the course materials.
