# Part 2: Neural Network Fundamentals

A self-contained introduction to building neural networks with PyTorch.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites Check**:
   - Completion of Part 1 (recommended)
   - Python 3.7+ with PyTorch support
   - Familiarity with calculus (derivatives)

2. **Setup Environment**:
   ```bash
   cd part2
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. **Start Learning**:
   - Begin with `recitation2.ipynb` for guided neural network construction
   - Then tackle `assignment2.ipynb` for independent implementation
