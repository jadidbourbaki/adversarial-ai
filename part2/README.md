Welcome to Part 2 of the Adversarial AI Course! In this module, you'll learn the fundamentals of deep learning using PyTorch and build a robust CNN for image classification.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Setup Your Environment
Follow the instructions in [`setup_instructions.md`](setup_instructions.md) to install required dependencies and set up your development environment.

### Step 2: Complete the Recitation
Work through `recitation2.ipynb` to understand the concepts through interactive demonstrations.

### Step 3: Complete the Assignment
Implement your solutions in `assignment2.ipynb` and submit your completed notebook plus analysis report.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Expectations

- **Recitation**: 30-60 minutes (interactive learning)
- **Assignment**: 60 minutes (implementation and analysis)
- **Total**: 1.5-2 hours for complete mastery
